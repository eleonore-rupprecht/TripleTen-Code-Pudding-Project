### Project Overview
This project analyzes dating app data provided by TripleTen. The data was cleaned and edited in Excel, then imported into Tableau for visualization and analysis. We focused on three main questions:  
1. **Whoâ€™s Swiping Right the Most?**  
2. **How Do Interests Influence Usage?**  
3. **Looking for Love or Just a Chat?**  

### Data Analysis & Visualization
We divided the tasks among the team and used various tools to visualize the data, including:  
- **Bar Charts**  
- **Pie Charts**  
- **Line Graphs**  
- **Trend Lines**  

### Key Findings

- **Top interests** overall are **cooking, travel,** and **sports**.

#### 3. Looking for Love or Just a Chat?
