# Part 1. Storytelling Rules & Criteria

## Turning data into a story

### Step 1: Think about the story before working with data
It’s better to brainstorm with your teammates on some ideas before diving into the datasets. Differing paths will make it easier to work with the data.

### Step 2: Choose insights that work better for the story
Focus on one or two insights that will become your story’s skeleton. Avoid too many leads that lead nowhere or distract from the main point.

### Step 3: Build a structure first and make sure you have everything you need for it to work
Write down your structure beforehand and discuss it with your colleagues. If your story misses details or more data, refer to different sources like fan pages, articles, or reports.

### Step 4: Think about visualizations
Data visualization plays a key role in data journalism. Find all kinds of ways to visualize the information that you find interesting.

### Step 5: Make your story clear and captivating
Visual essays are investigations that can be multiplied by your own personal opinion and/or the context you’re living in. Show it to your colleagues for feedback.

### Step 6: If there is a place for easter eggs, don’t forget them!
Reference data stories often contain easter eggs or gags to relax and entertain readers after a lot of information. These are not obligatory but can be smart and engaging.

# Part 2. Rules & Criteria for Data Analysis

## Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Decide with your team what aspect of the dataset you’d like to explore and display. Choose one of the datasets and conduct EDA on it. You may need to:
- Join tables
- Remove or fill in missing values
- Regroup data to focus on particular elements
- Create new columns for analyzing the data

## Part 2: Visualization
Decide on different ways to visualize the data after exploring it. Each of your visualizations should be unique.

## Part 3: Reporting Results - Presentation
Create a presentation with:
- An introduction to the dataset
  - What data do you have?
  - What did you do?
  - What are your major findings, briefly?
- Explanations of visualizations, giving broader context, and drawing conclusions
- A conclusion indicating what further explorations might be made into the dataset

## Reporting results for grading
Submit a link to a public GitHub repo with all of your working materials for assessment. Include:
- Tableau Workbook (or link to the published workbook)
- Presentation file/link
- Supporting documents (if any)

## Grading criteria for data work (20 points max)
- **Visualization use (10 points)**
  - Use various ways to visualize the data
  - Visualizations add to the story and are an integral part of it
  - All diagrams are described with captions and summaries

- **Presentation with results (10 points)**
  - The introduction sufficiently describes the data
  - Each visualization description fully explains the image
  - Conclusions are drawn clearly
  - Indicate next steps that might be taken
